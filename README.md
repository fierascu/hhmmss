What started as an itch and an IA code generation, ended up being a fun project.
The outcome should be a simple Java Spring Boot application that takes a filled timesheet and converts it to Docx.
As with food, the code has flavors. Some will like it, others will need more salt.

It was interesting to see how generative code behaves from IntelliJ's Junie or ChatGpt.
Sometimes it's amazing how successful and elegant the code can be, other times it's just plain to verbose or redundant.

Steps taken:
Ask ChatGpt from a dummy timesheet, to parse it and generate a Docx. 
Ask it to generate the code. 
Ask it to convert the pyton code to Java.
Started with https://www.jhipster.tech/, but it was too much for my needs.
The next choice was https://start.spring.io/.

ToDOs:
- [ ] Add UI
- [ ] Add export to PDF
- [ ] Host it somewhere
